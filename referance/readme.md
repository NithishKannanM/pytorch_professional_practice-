Reference Materials

This folder contains supporting learning resources used during deep learning practice.

These are reference materials, not core experiments.

Contents
docs/   → Structured PyTorch walkthroughs (fundamentals → modularization)
slides/ → Conceptual slides used to understand architectures and flow

Purpose

Reinforce conceptual understanding

Provide structured walkthroughs for PyTorch fundamentals

Serve as a learning reference alongside hands-on experimentation

All core implementations and experiments live outside this folder (ml/, cnn/, rnn/).

Note

This folder exists to keep theory and guided material separate from active practice, maintaining clarity in the repository structure.
