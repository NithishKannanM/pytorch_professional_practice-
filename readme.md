PyTorch Deep Learning Practice (Structured Learning)

This repository is a structured PyTorch practice workspace focused on building strong foundations in deep learning through implementation-first learning.

Instead of scattered tutorials, the goal here is to understand:

data → tensor → model → training flow

architectural differences (ML → CNN → RNN)

how PyTorch behaves as a framework, not just how to use APIs

The emphasis is on clarity, structure, and fundamentals, not state-of-the-art performance.

Repository Structure
ml/        → Classical ML pipelines and data handling
cnn/       → Convolutional Neural Networks (vision-focused)
rnn/       → Sequence models (minimal, concept-focused)
reference/ → Learning references (docs, slides, walkthroughs)

Learning Approach

One concept at a time

Minimal abstractions

Rebuilding models to understand tensor shapes, gradients, and training logic

Avoiding over-optimization and unnecessary complexity

This repo reflects how I learn deep learning, not a production-ready codebase.

Notes

Not designed for benchmarking or deployment

Code prioritizes readability and understanding

RNN/LSTM coverage is intentionally limited and conceptual

Status

Actively maintained as a learning reference and practice repo.
